# Semantic Release Action

A composite GitHub Action that wraps [cycjimmy/semantic-release-action](https://github.com/cycjimmy/semantic-release-action) to provide automated versioning and package publishing using [semantic-release](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release).

## Features

- ✅ **Automated Versioning**: Determines version bumps based on conventional commits
- ✅ **Changelog Generation**: Automatically generates CHANGELOG.md
- ✅ **Git Tags**: Creates and pushes semantic version tags
- ✅ **GitHub Releases**: Publishes releases with release notes
- ✅ **Conventional Commits**: Follows [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification
- ✅ **Flexible Configuration**: Supports branches, plugins, and custom workflows
- ✅ **Dry-Run Mode**: Test releases without publishing

## Quick Start

### Basic Usage

```yaml
name: Release

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  release:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      contents: write # Required for creating releases and tags
      issues: write # Required for commenting on issues
      pull-requests: write # Required for commenting on PRs
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0 # Required for semantic-release

      - uses: dsx-ai-factory/dsx-github-actions/.github/actions/semantic-release@main
        with:
          github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

## How It Works

### Conventional Commits

Semantic-release analyzes your commit messages to determine the next version:

| Commit Type            | Version Bump  | Example                                |
| ---------------------- | ------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| `fix:`                 | Patch (0.0.x) | `fix: resolve memory leak`             |
| `feat:`                | Minor (0.x.0) | `feat: add new API endpoint`           |
| `BREAKING CHANGE:`     | Major (x.0.0) | `feat!: redesign public API`           |
| `perf:`, `docs:`, etc. | No release    | Documentation/performance improvements |

**Example Commits:**

```bash
# Patch release (1.0.0 → 1.0.1)
git commit -m "fix: resolve null pointer exception"

# Minor release (1.0.0 → 1.1.0)
git commit -m "feat: add user authentication"

# Major release (1.0.0 → 2.0.0)
git commit -m "feat!: redesign API

BREAKING CHANGE: API endpoints have changed"
```

### Commit Message Format

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

**Common types:**

- `feat`: New feature (minor version bump)
- `fix`: Bug fix (patch version bump)
- `docs`: Documentation changes (no release)
- `style`: Code style changes (no release)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring (no release)
- `perf`: Performance improvements (patch version bump)
- `test`: Adding tests (no release)
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks (no release)
- `ci`: CI/CD changes (no release)

```

## Configuration

Create a `.releaserc.json` or `.releaserc.yml` file in your repository root:

### Basic Configuration

```json
{
  "branches": ["main"],
  "plugins": [
    "@semantic-release/commit-analyzer",
    "@semantic-release/release-notes-generator",
    "@semantic-release/github"
  ]
}
```

### Configuration with Changelog

```json
{
  "branches": ["main", "next"],
  "plugins": [
    "@semantic-release/commit-analyzer",
    "@semantic-release/release-notes-generator",
    "@semantic-release/changelog",
    "@semantic-release/github",
    "@semantic-release/git"
  ]
}
```

## Examples

### Example 1: Basic Release

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  release:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      contents: write
      issues: write
      pull-requests: write
    steps:

  with:
    extra-plugins: |
      @semantic-release/changelog@7.0.0

  "branches": ["main"],
  "plugins": [
    "@semantic-release/commit-analyzer",
    "@semantic-release/release-notes-generator",
    "@semantic-release/changelog",

      {
        "assets": ["CHANGELOG.md"],
        "message": "chore(release): ${nextRelease.version} [skip ci]\n\n${nextRelease.notes}"
      }
    ],
    "@semantic-release/github"
  ]
}
```

### Example 3: Multi-Branch Strategy

        {"name": "next", "prerelease": true},
        {"name": "beta", "prerelease": true}
      ]
```

          ci: "false"
```

### Example 6: Using Output Variables

```yaml

    with:
      fetch-depth: 0

  - name: Run Semantic Release
    id: release

  - name: Deploy New Version
    if: steps.release.outputs.new-release-published == 'true'
    run: |
      echo "Deploying version ${{ steps.release.outputs.new-release-version }}"
      ./deploy.sh ${{ steps.release.outputs.new-release-version }}

  - name: Notify Slack
    if: steps.release.outputs.new-release-published == 'true'
    run: |
      curl -X POST ${{ secrets.SLACK_WEBHOOK }} \
        -d "New release: v${{ steps.release.outputs.new-release-version }}"
```

### Example 7: NPM Package Publishing

```yaml
- uses: actions/setup-node@53b83947a5a98c8d113130e565377fae1a50d02f # v6.3.0
  with:
    node-version: "20"

- uses: dsx-ai-factory/dsx-github-actions/.github/actions/semantic-release@main
  with:
    extra-plugins: "@semantic-release/npm@12.0.0"
  env:
    NPM_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.NPM_TOKEN }}
```

**Configuration (.releaserc.json):**

```json
{
  "plugins": [
    "@semantic-release/commit-analyzer",
    "@semantic-release/release-notes-generator",
    "@semantic-release/npm",
    "@semantic-release/github"
  ]
}
```

## Common Plugins

### @semantic-release/changelog

Generates a CHANGELOG.md file:

```yaml
extra-plugins: "@semantic-release/changelog@7.0.0"
```

### @semantic-release/git

Commits assets (like CHANGELOG.md) back to the repository:

```yaml
extra-plugins: "@semantic-release/git@10.0.0"
```

### @semantic-release/npm

Publishes to npm registry:

```yaml
extra-plugins: "@semantic-release/npm@12.0.0"
```

### @semantic-release/exec

Executes custom scripts:

```yaml
extra-plugins: "@semantic-release/exec@6.0.0"
```

## Troubleshooting

### No Release Created

**Issue**: Semantic-release doesn't create a release.

**Solutions**:

1. Ensure commits follow conventional commit format
2. Check that you're on the correct branch (default: `main`)
3. Verify permissions are set correctly
4. Use `dry-run: "true"` to see what would happen

### Permission Denied

**Issue**: Error creating releases or tags.

**Solution**: Ensure the job has required permissions:

```yaml
permissions:
  contents: write
  issues: write
  pull-requests: write
```

### GITHUB_TOKEN has insufficient permissions

**Issue**: Default token doesn't have enough permissions.

**Solution**: Use a Personal Access Token (PAT):

```yaml
- uses: dsx-ai-factory/dsx-github-actions/.github/actions/semantic-release@main
  with:
    github-token: ${{ secrets.SEMANTIC_RELEASE_TOKEN }}
```

### Plugin Not Found

**Issue**: Extra plugin not installed.

**Solution**: Specify version and add to both `extra-plugins` and `.releaserc.json`:

```yaml
extra-plugins: |
  @semantic-release/changelog@7.0.0
  @semantic-release/git@10.0.0
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Use Conventional Commits

Enforce conventional commits with a commit linter:

**.commitlintrc.json:**

```json
{
  "extends": ["@commitlint/config-conventional"]
}
```

**package.json:**

```json
{
  "husky": {
    "hooks": {
      "commit-msg": "commitlint -E HUSKY_GIT_PARAMS"
    }
  }
}
```

### 2. Protect Main Branch

Configure branch protection rules:

- Require pull request reviews
- Require status checks to pass
- Require conventional commit messages

### 3. Skip CI for Release Commits

Add `[skip ci]` to release commits to avoid infinite loops:

```json
{
  "plugins": [
    [
      "@semantic-release/git",
      {
        "message": "chore(release): ${nextRelease.version} [skip ci]"
      }
    ]
  ]
}
```

### 4. Use Dry-Run for Testing

Test your semantic-release configuration in PRs:

```yaml
- uses: dsx-ai-factory/dsx-github-actions/.github/actions/semantic-release@main
  with:
    dry-run: "true"
```

### 5. Version Lock Plugins

Always specify plugin versions to prevent breaking changes:

```yaml
extra-plugins: |
  @semantic-release/changelog@7.0.0
  @semantic-release/git@10.0.0
```
