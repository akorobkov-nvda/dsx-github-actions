# Stale Issues and PRs Action

A composite GitHub Action that wraps [actions/stale](https://github.com/actions/stale) to automatically mark inactive issues and pull requests as stale and eventually close them. This keeps the issue tracker focused on active work.

## How It Works

```
Issue opened ──► 60 days idle ──► Labeled "lifecycle/stale" ──► 14 more days ──► Closed
PR opened    ──► 30 days idle ──► Labeled "lifecycle/stale" ──► 14 more days ──► Closed
```

### Default Exemptions

| Label | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `lifecycle/frozen` | Never marked stale (issues and PRs) |
| `priority/critical` | Never marked stale (issues only) |
| `good first issue` | Never marked stale (issues only) |
| `do-not-merge` | Never marked stale (PRs only) |

## Quick Start

```yaml
name: Stale Issues and PRs

on:
  schedule:
    - cron: "0 6 * * *"  # Daily at 6am UTC
  workflow_dispatch: {}

permissions:
  contents: read

jobs:
  stale:
    name: Mark stale issues and PRs
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      issues: write
      pull-requests: write
    timeout-minutes: 10
    steps:
      - uses: dsx-ai-factory/dsx-github-actions/.github/actions/stale-check@main
```

All inputs have sensible defaults, so zero configuration is needed to get started.
