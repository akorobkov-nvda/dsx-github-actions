# Commitlint Action

A GitHub Composite Action that validates commit messages against [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) using `commitlint`.

## Usage

```yaml
steps:
  - uses: actions/checkout@v4
    with:
      fetch-depth: 0  # Required to access commit history
  - name: Lint Commits
    uses: dsx-ai-factory/dsx-github-actions/.github/actions/commitlint@main
```

### With custom config

```yaml
steps:
  - uses: actions/checkout@v4
    with:
      fetch-depth: 0
  - name: Lint Commits
    uses: dsx-ai-factory/dsx-github-actions/.github/actions/commitlint@main
    with:
      config-file: '.commitlintrc.js'
```

## Inputs

| Input | Description | Required | Default |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `config-file` | Path to commitlint config file. If empty, uses default discovery. | `false` | `''` |
| `from` | Lint commits starting from this ref (exclusive). | `false` | `''` |
| `to` | Lint commits up to this ref (inclusive). | `false` | `HEAD` |
| `node-version` | Node.js version to use. | `false` | `20` |

## Behavior

1. **Set up Node.js** using `actions/setup-node`.
2. **Install commitlint** packages (`@commitlint/cli` and `@commitlint/config-conventional`).
3. **Determine commit range** automatically:
   - If `from` input is provided, uses that ref.
   - In PR context: lints commits from the base branch (`origin/$GITHUB_BASE_REF`).
   - In push context: lints only the latest commit (`HEAD~1..HEAD`).
   - On initial commits or shallow clones: lints `HEAD` only.
4. **Run commitlint** with verbose output.

## Notes

- The calling workflow must use `actions/checkout` with `fetch-depth: 0` (or at least enough depth to cover all commits in the PR) for commitlint to access the full commit range.
- npm packages are installed with `--ignore-scripts` for supply chain safety.
